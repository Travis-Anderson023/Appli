## Description
In the complicated and highly stressful environment of job searching, we want to help users track their application status. 

    Appli's will help users track the following: 
        - Company's applied to 
        - Application's Date
        - Response Received?
        - Contact at the company and their contact methods
        - Track your personalized cover letters

This is all done for you so you can be more organized, in the loop and prepare for your interview that we all stress about.

## Future Development 
- Word Tune Implementation

    Implement Word Tune API which will help our users refine their cover letter and be suggested a better way to word their experiences to present to companies.  

    [WordTune](https://www.wordtune.com/?utm_campaign=BrandSearch&ad_set_name=Wordtune&utm_source=google-search&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=BrandSearch&ad_set_name=Wordtune&utm_term=%2Bword%20%2Btune&gclid=CjwKCAjwi6WSBhA-EiwA6Niokxg4IQ4YQamrOI-UdYhl0SjTazhi6SkV7H3oj4rBirBVMrQwj4mYKBoCUFsQAvD_BwE)
- PDF Viewer
    
    Implement a PDF Viewer which will help our users by being able to upload PDF files of the cover letters instead of having to copy paste the text contents. This would enhance our user experience

    [React PDF](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pdf)
- AWS S3

    Implement AWS S3 so we can store and manage large quantities of user data and PDF's that our users will be uploading to our DB securely and efficiently.
